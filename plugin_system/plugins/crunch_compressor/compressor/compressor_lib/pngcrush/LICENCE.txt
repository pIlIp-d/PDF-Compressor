EXPORT CONTROL

I am not a lawyer, but I believe that the Export Control Classification
Number (ECCN) for pngcrush is EAR99, which means not subject to export
controls or International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) because it
and libpng and zlib which may be bundled with pngcrush are all open source,
publicly available software, that do not contain any encryption software.
See the EAR, paragraphs 734.3(b)(3) and 734.7(b).

TRADEMARK:

The name "pngcrush" has not been registered by the Copyright owner
as a trademark in any jurisdiction.  However, because pngcrush has
been distributed and maintained world-wide, continually since 1998,
the Copyright owner claims "common-law trademark protection" in any
jurisdiction where common-law trademark is recognized.
